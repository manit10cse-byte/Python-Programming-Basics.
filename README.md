# Python-Programming-Basics.
​🚌 Bus Fare Calculator
​A Python-based logic engine designed to calculate passenger fares dynamically based on age, distance traveled, and the day of the week.

📌Project Overview
This project was develpoed during my 2nd semester of B.Tech CSE(IOT & Cybersecurity) at CGC Landran. The goal was to implement a clean , efficient decision making logic using modern Python features like match-case

⚙️Features 

• Age-Based Pricing : Automated discount for children (under 12) and senior citizens(60+).
• Dynamic Day Logic : Weekday vs. Weekend pricing adjustments.
• Modern Python Syntax : Utilizes the match-case statement for high readability.
• Input Handling : Takes real-time user input for age,distance,and day.

🛠️ Tech Stack
• Language : Python 3.10+
• Concepts : Conditional Statements, Data type casting,F-string Formatting.
